## EVOTE Network Config

Note that this basic configuration uses pre-generated certificates and
key material, and also has predefined transactions to initialize a 
channel named "mychannel".

To regenerate this material, simply run ``generate.sh``.

To start the network, run ``start.sh``.
To stop it, run ``stop.sh``
To completely remove all incriminating evidence of the network
on your system, run ``teardown.sh``.
